= espeak-ruby

espeak-ruby is small Ruby API for utilizing 'espeak' and 'lame' to create Text-To-Speech mp3 files.

* eSpeak is a compact open source software speech synthesizer for English and other languages, for Linux and Windows. 
* LAME is a high quality MPEG Audio Layer III (MP3) encoder licensed under the LGPL. 

== Install

  gem install espeak-ruby

== Example

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'espeak-ruby'

  include ESpeak

  # Creates hello.mp3 file
  espeak("hello.mp3", :text => "Hello World") 
  
  # Creates /home/espeak/hello-de.mp3 file
  espeak("/home/espeak/hello-de.mp3", :text => "Hallo Welt", :voice => "de")

== Features

Currently only subset of espeak features is supported. 

  :voice => 'en',   # use voice file of this name from espeak-data/voices
  :pitch => 50,     # pitch adjustment, 0 to 99
  :speed => 170     # speed in words per minute, 80 to 370
  :quiet => true    # prevent espeak-ruby from printing to stdout. (default false)


These are default values, and they can be easily overridden:

  espeak("zdravo.mp3", :text => "Zdravo svete", :voice => "sr", :pitch => 90, :speed => 200)
